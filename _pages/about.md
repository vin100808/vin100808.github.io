An experienced software developer with a strong foundation in programming, notably in Python. Expertise extends to advanced data-mining, data preprocessing, and data analysis, further enriched by the application of machine learning techniques. This skill set is instrumental in tackling complex data challenges and deriving actionable insights, thereby contributing significantly to the success of various projects.

As a Software Engineer currently transitioning into the field of Data Science, I have a deep passion for `data` and its transformative power. This website is my `digital canvas`, where I'll be sharing insights from my journey towards becoming a Data Scientist. It will feature my projects, experiences, and the valuable lessons learned along the way. Join me as I explore the fascinating world of data science!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
