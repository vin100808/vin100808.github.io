      institution: Lifetech Cardio
      year: 01/2023 - 07/2023
      description:
        - Developed the Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) upper computer software functionalities, API ports using Flask and Cheroot libraries, and the corresponding fully automated testing processes utilizing the APIs.
        - Preprocessed data modeling using Python, Openpyxl, including bit manipulation, missing data, and data reduction.
        - Visualization of data and evaluation of IABP machine reliability and functionality using Tableau, Python and Excel.
        - Implemented classification and regression techniques to verify arterial pressure responses according to IABP operating stages, reducing 15% of manual oversight.
        - Optimized the communication module (IABP coded in Python) between the upper and lower computer, reducing the time per communication by an average of 20%.
        - Reimplemented IABP upper computer source code and API ports in C++ to further optimized the communication module and resolved the waveform stuttering problem.
